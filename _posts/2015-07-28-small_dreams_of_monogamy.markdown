Subtitled *a baker’s dozen of explode and make-up poems*, a collection of thirteen poems about relationships; their tentative triumphs and unmitigated disasters. Contains tales of sexual ambivalence, self-indulgent sentimentality, and the harsh language we reserve for those we love. By J.&#160;P.&#160;Ó&#160;Nuanáin.
