# Fairtheoir Thuaidh

This repository contains the code, images, and words for a publishing maisonette looked down upon by pygmies. A minuscule vanity publishing tent created to provide <abbr title="Universally unique identifier" class="initialism">U.U.I.D.</abbr>s for three poetry eBooks by J.P.&#160;Ó&#160;Nuanáin.

If published at all, the site should be available at: [isfeargoidte.me.uk/FairtheoirThuaidh/](https://isfeargoidte.me.uk/FairtheoirThuaidh/).
